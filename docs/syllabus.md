# Biosystems Analytics 434/534 (3 units)

Asynchronous Online Format; Weekly modules completed at your own pace.
	
## Description of Course

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Python for data analytics. This course teaches students Python’s basic data types and structures like strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. In addition, the course focuses on testing code by writing small functions to develop larger, testable programs. As programs become complex, this “test-driven development strategy” ensures that code is robust and can be delivered to the community as cutting-edge open source packages. The course focuses on hands-on coding exercises to develop practical coding skills for interpreting and analyzing high-dimensional biological data. Students work independently and collaboratively online via Slack to gain skills in:

- basic Python data structures 
- writing and testing functions and programs, 
- using Python to read/write/parse files, and 
- using regular expressions. 

These skills are taught by implementing real-world coding examples to manipulate and process data in Python and test out your new skills through writing games in Python.

## Course Prerequisites or Corequisites

An Apple or Windows computer. 
Some experience programming Python is useful but not required.

## Course Objectives

The course objective is to teach formal, structured methods to write Python well. This course introduces techniques seasoned programmers use daily, from how to start writing a new program, to how to verify that it actually works. This course teaches students basic python data structures, loops, functions, and regular expressions using simple puzzles and games. Once students have mastered these coding concepts and practices, they can be applied broadly to advanced concepts in scientific computing and biological data.

Expected Learning Outcomes
This course is designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of manipulating data in Python. Upon completing this course students will be able to: 

- Write command-line Python programs; 
- Process a variety of command-line arguments, options, and flags; 
- Write and run tests for your programs and functions; 
- Manipulate of Python data structures including strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries; 
- Use higher-order functions like map and filter; 
- Write and use regular expressions; 
- Read, parse, and write various text formats; 
- Use and control randomness; 
- Use these skills to write challenging games in Python.

All students will complete a class project at the end of the semester, however, Graduate students will be required to complete a more detailed and complicated project than Undergraduates. 

## Course Format and Teaching Methods

The course is taught using an asynchronous online format, that allows students to work at their own pace through online videos with live-coding examples that demonstrate core concepts, an interactive group discussion (via slack) to get help from other students and the instructor, and weekly quizzes and homework assignments that reinforce concepts. Importantly, because the development of scripting skills is essential to this class, programming homework and quizzes must be completed weekly.  

## Absence and Class Participation Policy

Watching weekly videos and completing quizzes and assignments is vital to the class. As such, all assignments are due at the end of the week (Sunday at 11:59 pm). Students who miss assignments due to illness or emergency are required to bring documentation from their health-care provider or other relevant, professional third parties. Failure to submit third-party documentation will result in missing/ungraded assignments for the week.

The UA’s policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop 


The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable, http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy.

Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of Students (or Dean Designee) will be honored.  See:  https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences  

Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late
Students who register after the first class meeting may make up missed assignments/quizzes within the first two weeks of class.

## Weekly Learning Modules

Each week's learning module consists of: reading assignments, instructional videos, a practice quiz, and a homework assignment. All practice exercises and homework assignments are on the course GitHub site https://github.com/hurwitzlab/be434-Spring2024 and linked in D2L. All readings, videos, and quizzes are on D2L. 

## Homework

The homework provides you with practice in scripting and analytics. Homework is turned in by committing your code to your GitHub repository that is shared with the instructor. Each week's homework is assigned on Monday at 8:00am and due on Sunday at 11:59pm. On the following Monday, the instructor will download your code from GitHub. Your grade will be based on the percentage of tests you pass in the provided test suite with each homework assignment. I encourage group work (via Slack) but be sure the code you turn in has been independently written (see Code of Academic Integrity below). In addition, code should not be written using generative AI resources like ChatGPT. 

## Quizzes

Each week, you will be tested on the exercises, videos and reading for that week (see the schedule) through a Practice Quiz on D2L. Students can take the quiz up to two times to learn the material and improve their scores.

## Final Project

At the end of the semester, each student will implement a program in Python via the class project that demonstrates the core programming concepts for the class. Students can select from several progamming projects, wherein Graduate students will select from more difficult problems than Undergraduates.
